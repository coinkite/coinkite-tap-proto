# Coinkite Tap Protocol and Helper Program

This Python library enables easy communication with **TAPSIGNER<sup>&trade;</sup>**,  **SATSCARD<sup>&trade;</sup>** and **SATSCHIP<sup>&trade;</sup>**.

**-==[Request card development samples [here](https://coinkite.cards/dev)]==-**

Repository contents:

1. The protocol specification
2. Python library for speaking the protocol
3. Supporting documentation

Examples/Libraries in other languages will be added when available.

# Install

## Setup For Everyday Use

First update `pip` to latest version and install wheel (otherwise
legacy setup.py install will be used)

```shell
pip install -U pip wheel
```

Install `cktap`, our helpful command-line program, with just:

    pip install 'coinkite-tap-protocol[cli]'

**OR**

If you just want the Python library by itself, use: `pip install coinkite-tap-protocol`


## Setup If You Might Change the Code

1. Do a git checkout
2. Make a fresh virtualenv (suggested)
3. Run:

```
# only library
pip install --editable .
# or with cktap cmdline utility
pip install --editable '.[cli]'
# for testing purposes
pip install --editable '.[test]'
```

This installs `cktap` and any changes you make will be immediately
reflected in the installed version.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- `pyscard` for access to smart card readers
- A supported smart card reader. In theory, all smart card USB CCID class-compliant
  devices should work. Our observations:
    - **ACS ACR1252U** - okay and widely available, and for sale by Coinkite
    - **Identiv uTrust 3700F** - reliable and looks nice
    - **HID Omnikey 5022 CL** (not 5021) - fast, cute, and small
    - **NOT recommended:** ACS ACR122U. It can work, and is widely available, but is not reliable.
- See `requirements.txt` file for python packages needed.


## Ubuntu/Debian Notes
Installing `pyscard` require SWIG and libpcsclite:
```shell
# run below before installing dependencies with pip
# tested on Ubuntu 20.04 (only)
sudo apt-get install swig
sudo apt-get install libpcsclite-dev
```

## Windows Notes

Installing `pyscard` may require SWIG:

1. Download .zip from <http://swig.org>.
2. Extract and move into `C:\Program Files`.
3. Add that to system PATH.
4. Test: `swig` at command prompt should work.
5. Run `pip install pyscard`.


## FreeBSD Notes

Tested against 13.0-RELEASE.

1. `pkg install py38-pyscard py38-coincurve`
    - follow devfs.conf instructions
    - install usr/ports/devel/libccid
    - add `pcscd_enable="YES"` to rc.conf
2. `pip install base58`
3. `pip install -e git+https://github.com/coinkite/python-bip32.git@iss27#egg=bip32`
4. Make your virtualenv with: `virtualenv ENV --system-site-packages`
5. `pkg install py38-secp256k1` (pulls a tragic set of dependencies)

**NOTE:** SWIG is needed to build wheel for `pyscard`. You may need to run `pkg install swig`.


## Emulator

Python code for an emulator which communicates with `cktap`
via a local Unix socket. It's provided without warranty and isn't
installed by default. `cktap` prefers to speak to the emulator
if it is running.

See [README for emulator](emulator/README.md).

# Using the Library

### SATSCARD

```python
>>> from cktap.transport import find_first
>>> card = find_first()
>>> print(card)
<CKTapCard SATSCARD via NFC: 26NKY-RWPK4-65YR7-BU4WL>
>>> card.address()
'bc1q7h0u5yn8y4pajn94ze4gnhz487c8ysvekusqj5'
```

### TAPSIGNER

```python
>>> from cktap.transport import find_first
>>> card = find_first()
>>> print(card)
<CKTapCard TAPSIGNER via EMU: 2LNJA-NIGMW-Q5AKC-KD5Q2> 
>>> card.get_xpub('123456')
'xpub6DXuQW17LykdXFyEtRrq9Z3MAegRPLAwFovT34afzK6NNHkwJrWCs4Knhrjf1U22QSSbykyzpfRsDZc9ryk9b6VUfGp89vkQw6YjY4CaEQ3'
```

# Using the CLI


## Providing CVC

Any command which reveals private key info or changes the state of
the card requires the 6-digit numeric code from the back of the
card (called _CVC_, _spend code_, or _Starting PIN Code_ on TAPSIGNER).
You can provide this on the command line, or omit it. Commands
requiring the CVC but entered without it will prompt you for the
CVC.  Some commands display limited information without the CVC.
To see more detail, include the CVC on the command line.


## Most Useful Commands

### cktap library

`cktap --version`
- Get the version of cktap library

### For SATSCARD

`cktap open`
- Opens Bitcoin Core or your other wallet by activating the BITCOIN:addr URL scheme for the current slot of the card.

`cktap qr`
- Displays deposit QR code.

`cktap unseal`
- Unseals the current slot and shows the WIF for funds sweeping.
- WIF must be imported into a blockchain-aware wallet.

`cktap balance`
- Calls a web service to get UTXO and show current Bitcoin balance.
- Uses `tord` (if running locally) to proxy the request.


### For TAPSIGNER

`cktap status`
- Shows status info.

`cktap setup`
- Tells card to pick private key (call once).

`cktap xpub`
- Shows the XPUB in effect.

`cktap backup`
- Saves the card's XPRV into an AES-128-CTR encrypted file with the current date.

`cktap change OLDPINCODE NEWPINCODE`
- Use to change the PIN on the card

`cktap path`
- Shows the derivation path in effect, by default: `m/84h/0h/0h`

### For SATSCHIP

`cktap upload -i /path/to/image.jpg`
- collects artwork meta data (title, description, etc) and uploads signed
  result to public server
