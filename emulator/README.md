```

Command usage:

```shell
# emulate a factory-fresh card
% ./ecard.py emulate -f
```

```shell
# emulate a SATSCARD with first slot populated, certificate chain installed
% ./ecard.py emulate
```

```shell
# emulate a TAPSIGNER with no key picked yet
% ./ecard.py emulate -t --no-init
```

```shell
# emulate a TAPSIGNER with key already picked
% ./ecard.py emulate -t
```

When emulating a card, commands can be sent to the Unix domain pipe
at `/tmp/ecard-pipe` as CBOR objects. Responses are CBOR to be decoded.
